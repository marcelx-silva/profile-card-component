## My process

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Reset CSS
- Flexbox


### What I learned
During this project I've learned some CSS3 properties to positioning and set background  images and a little bit more about media queries. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
@media(max-width:375px) {
   .card{
        //code
      }
      ...
}
```

```css
 background-image:
    url(./images/bg-pattern-top.svg),
    url(./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg);
    background-repeat:  no-repeat;
    background-position: -80% 110%, 160% -60% ;
```

### Continued development

After this project I will focus more on pseudo-elements to learn more about it and continue to practice Javascript to implement in future projects. 

### Useful resources

- [Controlling background-images | CSS Tutorial - by Kevin Powell](https://youtu.be/3T_Jy1CqH9k) - This helped me for positioning images in the website and I have learned that it is possible to position two or more background images.
